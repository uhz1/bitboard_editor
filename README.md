Edit bitboards with this program. Requires SDL2 to be installed (homebrew for mac)

If not on mac m*, remove the "leaks --atExit" line from run.py

Click on the number display to change from hex, binary, and decimal.

TODO:
- Add majority of button functionality (and keybind)
- Make look prettier
- Universal compilation script
- Add m * n grid option (can handle up to 255 x 255 currently, but options are only for 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)
